# openssl-python

This tool is a command line interface to OpenSSL, written with Python3.
It permits encrypting/decrypting files, as well as generating RSA keys, encrypting private RSA keys, signing files using an RSA key, and also verifying signatures using RSA.  
  
## Dependencies
  
Before running this tool, the following dependency must be installed, as well as being on the path:
